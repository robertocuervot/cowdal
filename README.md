# cowdal
COW - DAL is a data acquisition module (pH, temperature, average flow, total volume) designed to be coupled to existing mechanical milking stations in the country, which together with a cow identification system (RFID) and data analysis software will allow low- and medium-sized dairy farmers who have purchased a mechanical milking system to be offered a method of quickly and orderly viewing a glossary of value figures on their production, efficiency and "quality" current and historical with a global approach or an individual approach from any device with internet access.

- In the WebDevelopment folder are all the files corresponding to the website design and database connection.

- In the MATLAB_files folder are all the files corresponding to the Matlab codes that graph the data received in the ThingSpeak channel for each variable. There is currently just the file that graphs the temperature.
